## üìã **Problem Statement**

The need for a cost-effective and reliable system to:
- Acquire real-time environmental data (e.g., temperature).
- Synchronize and log this data with accurate time information.
- Communicate the processed data to a PC for analysis and display.

## ‚úÖ **Solution**

A PC-based data acquisition system is developed using an LPC2129 microcontroller. It reads time from an RTC module and temperature data from a sensor via I2C and SPI. The data is transmitted to a PC via RS232 for logging and visualization.
